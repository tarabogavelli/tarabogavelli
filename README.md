### Hi!!  👋👋

My name is Tara. I'm currently an undergraduate student at Barnard College, Columbia University studying **Computer Science**💻 and **Political Science** 📖.

I really love reading 📚, crafts 🪡🎨🖌️ (mostly embroidery and painting), and going for walks! I also enjoy making personal projects in my free time. Most of my projects relate to reading and can be found here on Github.
